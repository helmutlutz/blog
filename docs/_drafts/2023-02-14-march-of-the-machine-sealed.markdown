Recently, the newest MTG stet was released but I missed the prerelease because my local store messed up the reservations. Whatever, I still wanted to do it, so I bought two prerelease packs and played my own Sealed. Same outcome, less time pressure: You get to open the pack, test your deckbuilding skill, and have a good time with friends.

As in my other MTG posts, I'll share my thoughts on the set, and some of the lessons that I learned. If you're interested in learning from pros, there are plenty of resources available online, such as [Card Game Base][cardgamebase], [Draftsim][draftsim], or [MTG Arena Zone][mtgazone].

## An overview of the format for beginners like me
As with most deck-building games, the objective is to strike the right balance between creature-spells, instant-spells, sorceries, etc. while also achieving some degree of synergy between the cards. As far as my experience goes, the Sealed format is a great way to learn how to use limited resources, to try new strategies and card mechanics, and above all to have fun with the new set of cards.  

Throughout the tournament you play a series of best-of-three games with three opponents. That means you typically play 9 games unless some games take too long.  

Here are the main set mechanics to consider when building a deck:  
- Battles, the first new card type in 16 years. Essentially they are non-creature permanents, which typically come into play with an effect. As they enter the game, you choose an opponent to "defend" them. When you manage to "defeat" them, they're exiled and can be cast transformed. So in other terms, by playing a battle, you're setting up a "mini-game" which has the transformed card as prize.
- Incubate: Double-sided tokens.
- Backup is an ETB mechanic (enter-the-battlefield) which puts counters on your creatures - plus the card with backup gives the target creature its abilities until the end of turn.
- Convoke is a mechanic that allows your creatures to cast a card with "convoke" by tapping for one mana.
  
From these mechanics and their distribution in the 5 colors, you get the following archetypes:
- UW: Knights tribal, aggro / wide board  
- UB: Mill (both graveyards)  
- BR: Sacrifice, tokens  
- RG: Battles and big creatures  
- GW: +1/+1 counters  
- WB: Phyrexian tribal, uncommons, incubate mechanic  
- UR: Convoke mechanic, "spellslinger"  
- BG: Midrange, incubate mechanic  
- RW: Backup, aggro  
- UG: Transform
