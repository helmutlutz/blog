In October 2023, I visited the Spiel, the world's largest public fair for board games held in Essen, Germany. With round about 193,000 visitors and 935 exhibitors from 56 countries, it was truly an international celebration of tabletop gaming.

## Evolution of the Spiel  
The Spiel has evolved significantly over the years. Originally geared towards family games, the fair has shifted its focus towards increasingly complex and strategic games for adults. This change is reflected in the average age of attendees, which hovers around 30. However, despite this shift, there is still a strong emphasis on family-friendly gaming experiences, evident in the variety of games available for all ages.

## What's trending  
One notable trend that you can observe at the Spiel was the prevalence of themes centered around nature and sustainability. Board game developers are increasingly incorporating these themes into their designs, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues among players. It's refreshing to see games that not only entertain but also educate and raise awareness about important global issues.  

## Navigating the fair
One of the highlights of my experience at the Spiel was the convenience of the event app. This app allowed attendees to bookmark games and exhibitors in advance, helping to optimize their route through the fair. This feature was invaluable in navigating the vast halls filled with hundreds of exhibitors and thousands of games.

## Personal highlight
Among the plethora of games showcased, a few stood out as personal favorites. One such game was Dizzy Lizzy. This versatile game offers a range of play modes suitable for players of all ages and skill levels, making it an ideal choice for families. I was so impressed by Dizzy Lizzy that I purchased two copiesâ€”one for myself and one as a gift for our kindergarten. The game's "party package" with promotional items like buttons and stickers added to its appeal.

## Exploring new games
During my time at Spiel Essen, I had the opportunity to try out several new games, including Deep Sea Adventure, Tiger and Dragon, Micro Dojo, Kelp - Shark vs. Octopus, and Laniakea. Each game offered a unique and engaging experience, showcasing the diversity and creativity present in the board gaming industry.

## Engaging experiences
One of the most memorable aspects of Spiel Essen was the level of engagement at exhibitor stands. Whether it was playing a round of a new game or receiving a demonstration from enthusiastic staff members, each interaction was enjoyable and informative. It's no surprise that these engaging experiences often led to purchases, as demonstrated by my own shopping cart.

## Conclusion
The Spiel was a celebration of all things board games, from the latest innovations to timeless classics. With its diverse range of games, engaging exhibitors, and welcoming atmosphere, it's no wonder that it remains a highlight for gaming enthusiasts around the world.
  
As I reflect on my time at the Spiel, I am reminded of the joy and camaraderie that board games bring to people of all ages. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the hobby, there's something for everyone to enjoy at this extraordinary event. So far, see you next year in Essen!
