Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Helmut, and my passions are techy stuff on one side (I'm a Data Scientist) and craft & art projects on the other side. I love to explore new ideas and concepts in these fields and enjoy sharing my discoveries with others.

I started this blog because I believe that the process of writing about what I read and learn is an excellent way to uncover "blind spots" and to simplify complicated topics. Additionally, I hope that my insights can be helpful to others who stumble upon my blog.

In my free time, there's a permanent rotation of leisure activities that I enjoy, such as playing card games or exploring my artistic side through painting. I believe in the importance of finding balance in life, and these hobbies allow me to recharge after a long day. Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope that you find my posts informative, engaging, and entertaining!

Finally, the one thing left to say here is a disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this blog are my own and no one else's.
