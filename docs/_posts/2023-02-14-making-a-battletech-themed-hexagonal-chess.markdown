If you're a fan of the Battletech universe, you might know that there are several tabletop games available to play. However, these games can be quite expensive and complex, making it difficult for casual players to enjoy. So, why not create your own Battletech-inspired game that is both affordable and easy to play?

In this post, I'll share my experience of creating a Battletech-inspired hexagonal chess variant. This was a birthday present for a very close friend, and a fellow Battletech enthusiast, who I knew would appreciate and enjoy a game like this.

## Step 1: Creating the Play Pieces

To create the play pieces, I purchased a large block of black/white polymer clay and rolled it into a baguette-like shape. I then sliced the clay into 0.5 mm thick pieces and shaped them into 3x3 cm hexagonal play pieces. To ensure that the edges were equal, I used a ruler and a hexagon stencil that I cut out of cardboard. Once the pieces were shaped, I baked them in the oven (follow the suppliers instructions for this).

## Step 2: Sanding and Polishing the Pieces

After baking the pieces, I sanded them with sandpaper of grain size 120, followed by wet sandpaper of grain size 800. Finally, I polished the pieces with my orbital sander using a felt pad and a wool pad.

## Step 3: Creating the Board

To create the board, I purchased 3x3 cm wooden hexagons from Amazon and dyed them with coffee (yes, that really works). Hex-chess requires three colors, so I left a third undyed, dyed another third once, and dyed the last third 3-4 times to achieve the desired contrast between the tiles. I dyed the board in the same way.

## Step 4: Gluing the Pieces to the Board

To glue the pieces to the board, my dad created a blueprint using AutoCAD (I guess Powerpoint would also work). I taped the blueprint to a table and covered it with lines of transparent package tape, sticky side up.

I then arranged the hexagons on the tape (matching the blueprint below) and made sure they stuck to the tape and couldn't move anymore (undyed side up).

Next, I added glue and placed the board on top, followed by some heavy books for additional pressure. I waited for 1-2 hours, and this step was finished.

## Step 5: Illustrating the Tiles

For the black tiles, the background of the illustrations had to match the color of the play pieces. To hit the right color for the background, I created a "test card" and compared it to the play pieces.

I then used black and white /images from [sarna.net][sarna] and removed their background with Photoshop. I added color and patterns, arranged them in a 10x15 cm format, and had them printed as photos in a local shop.

## Step 6: Gluing the Mechs to the Pieces

Finally, I glued the mechs onto the polymer clay pieces.

Here's the finished game:

In conclusion, creating a Battletech-inspired hexagonal chess variant is a fun and affordable way to enjoy epic mech battles in the Battletech universe. With some basic materials and a little bit of creativity, you can create a game that is easy to play (but challenging to master) in your own favorite fantasy- or scifi setting.
