![Rares from the event](/images/phyrexia-all-will-be-one-sealed/ONE-sealed-event.jpg)

Have you ever attended a *Sealed* event for Magic: The Gathering (MTG)? If you're unfamiliar with the game, a sealed event is a type of tournament where players are given a set number of cards and have to build a deck from them on the spot. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend my first sealed event for the newest MTG set, "Phyrexia: All will be one". While I'm still relatively new to the game, the experience was both exciting and challenging.

In this blog post, I'll share my thoughts on the event, the set, and some of the lessons I went home with. Keep in mind, this won't be a guide per se, but rather a personal reflection on my first sealed experience. If you're interested in learning more about the format, there are plenty of resources available online, such as [Card Game Base][cardgamebase], [Draftsim][draftsim], or [MTG Arena Zone][mtgazone].

## An overview of the format for beginners like me
As with most deck-building games, the objective is to strike the right balance between creature-spells, instant-spells, sorceries, etc. while also achieving some degree of synergy between the cards. As far as my experience goes, the Sealed format is a great way to learn how to use limited resources, to try new strategies and card mechanics, and above all to have fun with the new set of cards.

Throughout the tournament I played a series of best-of-three games with three opponents. That means you typically play 9 games unless some games take too long. At the end, your stats are compared in a leaderboard, and you get prizes in the form of booster packs. I mentioned already that I was a total beginner but where I played, they even handed out a booster pack for each at the end of the leaderboard - what a nice welcome present to the MTG community :P

## Lessons learned
- Splashing
	- Splashing needs some more lands apart from fetchlands. I never played splashed decks before, so I never bothered to so some research on splashing. One bad choice was to include my signature card (1, 1R, 1G). In order to cast that card consistently on curve, I would have needed 9 mountains (for a 75% chance). A good article on why this was a bad idea can be found here: [To Splash or Not to Splash in Limited?][splashing-limited]
		- As a rule of thumb, you want to have 4-5 lands for 1-2 colored spells (with only one colored mana), to consistently cast a spell "on curve"
		- Splash only for cards with high converted mana cost
		- Splash only for single colored-cards
		- Splash only for really good removal spells, or really powerful finishers.
		- If your main color only has cards with 2C, 3C, 4C, and/or 4CC, take 8 lands. If it has cards with C, 1C, or 3CC take 9 lands. If you have 1CC and/or 2CC spells, better go to 10 lands.
		- From all of this follows: avoid splashing in an aggressive deck or when you have double-colored spells
		- Avoid 7-7-3 Mana Bases. Instead, use multiple dual-lands or mana fixers along with a single land of the splash color to not harm the consistency of your main colors.
	- Fetchlands, or cards that fetch you a land when they come into play, are not only important in case you are splashing, but also when you have cards that require multiple mana sources of one color
	- Some notes on "Evolving Wilds" (which I got a lot from Midnight Hunt): The main problem with Evolving Wilds is the land comes into play tapped, making it the worst of the fetchlands. In an aggressive deck, you cannot afford to waste a single turn by waiting for the right color. If you play Control, you can compensate for that by playing enough disruptors, until your big threats are on the board.

- The premium promo card: This is a card which is included in the prerelease pack. What I've heard was that even experienced players fall into the trap of getting too fixated on this card and try to accommodate it in the deck when they shouldn't. Must be something psychological. Not surprising that I also fell for this one and, for the reasons given in the previous point about splashing, it made the deck weaker than it would be.

- Shuffling: I was told that I was too slow with shuffling, understandable since it was my first play under time pressure. So, the tip for beginners is: 
  - Put six cards in front of you and start putting down cards on each of the piles 
  - When you're done, put the piles together and give it one iteration of shuffling. That's it.

- Keep in mind your cards with flashback which are in the graveyard. Wouldn't have mattered, but I still realized twice that I forgot about them.

- Keep the curve low. ONE was a quite aggressive set and I'm guilty of underestimating that. After the first two matches I realized that I had to replace a 5- and 6 drop with a 2- and 3-drop. Worked much better. 

## Final words
All in all, it was a fun experience, and I learned a lot. More than I would've learned playing MTG Arena for 3 months. So far, stay curious and keep learning!
