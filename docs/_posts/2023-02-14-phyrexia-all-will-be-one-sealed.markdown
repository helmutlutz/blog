# A premiere
This post is a premiere. It's about my first "real" experience with the trading card game *Magic: The Gathering*. At the time of writing this, I'm still a hopeless beginner, so don't expect a "guide" or anything. If you want to learn about the set or the format, there are plenty of good articles in places like Draftsim, MTG Arena Zone, or Star City Games.  

A couple of days ago I attended my first *Sealed* event for the Prerelease of the set "Phyrexia: All Will Be One", and for me it was a really great experience. There were nice people who chatted with me, helped me out, gave me tips, suggested improvements for my deck, and above all were very patient with me. On the other hand, it was still a challenging experience due to the time restrictions for all phases of the event.

# An overview of the format for beginners like me
For those reading this who haven't figured out by now what I'm talking about, here is a little bit of background information: A *Sealed Event* is small tournament where each player receives 6 "booster" packs with random playing cards. Then you are given a limited amount of time to construct a deck of 40 cards by only using and combining the cards you received.

The objective is to strike the right balance between creature-spells, instant-spells, sorceries, etc. while also building in some degree of synergy between the cards. As far as my experience goes, the Sealed format is a great way to learn how to use limited resources, to solve complex "optimization" problems, and to try new strategies and card mechanics.

Throughout the tournament I played a series of best-of-three games with three opponents. That means you typically play 9 games unless some games take too long. At the end, your stats are compared in a leaderboard and you get prizes in the form of booster packs. I mentioned already that I was a total beginner but where I played they even handed out a booster pack for each at the end of the leaderboard - what a nice welcome present to the MTG community :P

# Lessons learned
- Splashing
	- Splashing needs some more lands apart from fetchlands. I never played splashed decks before, so I never bothered to so some research on splashing. One bad choice was to include my signature card (1, 1R, 1G). In order to cast that card consistently on curve, I would have needed 9 mountains (for a 75% chance). A good article on why this was a bad idea can be found here: [To Splash or Not to Splash in Limited? on ChannelFireball.com][splashing-limited]
		- As a rule of thumb, you want to have 4-5 lands for 1-2 colored spells (with only one colored mana), to consistently cast a spell "on curve"
		- Splash only for cards with high converted mana cost
		- Splash only for single colored-cards
		- Splash only for really good removal spells, or really powerful finishers.
		- If your main color only has cards with 2C, 3C, 4C, and/or 4CC, take 8 lands. If it has cards with C, 1C, or 3CC take 9 lands. If you have 1CC and/or 2CC spells, better go to 10 lands.
		- From all of this follows: avoid splashing in an Aggro deck or when you have double-colored spells
		- Avoid 7-7-3 Mana Bases. Instead, use multiple dual-lands or mana fixers along with a single land of the splash color to not harm the consistency of your main colors.
	- Fetchlands, or cards that fetch you a land when they come into play, are not only important in case you are splashing, but also when you have cards that require multiple mana sources of one color
	- Some notes on "Evolving Wilds" (which I got a lot from Midnight Hunt): The main problem with Evolving Wilds is the land comes into play tapped, making it the worst of the fetchlands. In an Aggro deck, you cannot afford to waste a single turn by waiting for the right color. If you play Control, you can compensate for that by playing enough disruptors, until your big threats are on the board.

- The premium promo card: This is a card which is included in the prerelease pack. What I've heard was that even experienced players fall into the trap of getting too fixated on this card and try to accommodate it in the deck when they shouldn't. Must be something psychological. Not surprising that I also fell for this one and, for the reasons given in the previous point about splashing, it made the deck weaker than it would be.

- Shuffling: I was told that I was too slow with shuffling, understandable since it was my first play under time pressure. So, the tip for beginners is: 
  - Put six cards in front of you and start putting down cards on each of the piles 
  - When you're done, put the piles together and give it one iteration of shuffling. That's it.

- Keep in mind your cards with flashback which are in the graveyard. Wouldn't have mattered, but I still realized twice that I forgot about them.

- Keep the curve low. ONE was a pretty aggro set and I'm guilty of underestimating that. After the first two matches I realized that I had to replace a 5- and 6 drop with a 2- and 3-drop. Worked much better. 

# Final words
It was a fun experience, and I learned a lot. More than I would've learned playing MTG Arena for 3 months. There's simply no replacement for the real thing. Until next time!
