![Rares from the event](/images/march-of-the-machine-sealed/article_header.jpg)

Recently, the newest MTG stet was released and I missed the prerelease because my local store messed up the reservations. But since you can buy the prerelease packs, why not do my own "event" with a friend? Same outcome, less time pressure: You get to open the pack, test your skills, and have a good time with friends.

As in my other MTG posts, I'll share my thoughts on the set, and some of the lessons that I learned. If you're interested in learning from pros, there are plenty of resources available online, such as [Card Game Base][cardgamebase], [Draftsim][draftsim], or [MTG Arena Zone][mtgazone].

## An overview of the format for beginners like me
As with most deck-building games, the objective is to strike the right balance between creature-spells, instant-spells, sorceries, etc. while also achieving some degree of synergy between the cards. As far as my experience goes, the Sealed format is a great way to learn how to use limited resources, to try new strategies and card mechanics, and above all to have fun with the new set of cards.  

Throughout the tournament you play a series of best-of-three games with three opponents. That means you typically play 9 games unless some games take too long.  

## Main set mechanics
When building a deck, it boils down to keeping the main mechanics in mind to get extra value from synergies:  
- Battles, the first new card type in 16 years. Essentially, they are non-creature permanents, which typically come into play with an effect. As they enter the game, you choose an opponent to "defend" them. When you manage to "defeat" them, they're exiled and can be cast transformed. So, in other terms, by playing a battle, you're setting up a "mini-game" which has the transformed card as prize.
- Incubate: Double-sided tokens.
- Backup is an ETB mechanic (enter-the-battlefield) which puts counters on your creatures - plus the card with backup gives the target creature its abilities until the end of turn.
- Convoke is a mechanic that allows your creatures to cast a card with "convoke" by tapping for one mana.
  
From these mechanics and their distribution in the 5 colors, you get the following archetypes:
- UW: Knights tribal, aggro / wide board  
- UB: Mill (both graveyards)  
- BR: Sacrifice, tokens  
- RG: Battles and big creatures  
- GW: +1/+1 counters  
- WB: Phyrexian tribal, uncommons, incubate mechanic  
- UR: Convoke mechanic, "spellslinger"  
- BG: Midrange, incubate mechanic  
- RW: Backup, aggro  
- UG: Transform  

## Lessons learned
For my lessons learned, note that I ended up in RW - an aggressive deck with lots of backup cards.
- Battles: Though interesting as a new card type, they really shouldn't be picked for an aggro deck. First, you're spending resources which should be spent on building your board quickly. Second, once you start attacking a battle, you're basically gifting your opponent as many life points as there are defense counters on the battle (wasting time & rounds you don't have).
- I played against UW (Knights, aggro), which exposed that I didn't have enough flying creatures to counter attacks effectively in the first game. That reminded me of one of the first rules that I learned for limited games: Prioritize creatures with evasion, removal spells, and powerful finishers.
- It was the "removal spells and powerful finishers"-part that won my other game - You might have noticed in the header image that I was lucky enough to pick Elesh Norn, which can win games on its own. 

## Final words
From what I've seen so far, *March of the Machine* is a really nice set. I think there's more variation in the cards and in the strategies than in the previous set (ONE). I also liked the additional Battle cards. Unfortunately, I didn't see one of the Companion cards (10 cards from Ikoria with special rules) - I think my friend got one but wasn't able to use it. So far, see you for the next event!
